Title: Deriving Slope from Side Profile Images
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Will Booker
Maintainer: Will Booker <will.booker95@gmail.com>
Description: This package converts a series of images to slope and pool depth 
    values. This requires three main user derived inputs. The first is a vector
    identifying the images to be used and ignored. The second is a randomForest
    model relating the pixel values to classes. The third is corrected real space
    coordinate rasters to convert the calculated pixel values into real slope and
    depth values.
